#####The Concept


- Websites are developed for each and every company for business reasons. 

- These websites are viewed from different devices, say mobiles, tablets and even laptops that are of different sizes and shapes.

- To build a successful website, the company has to make sure it doesnâ€™t lose its users. 

- For this reason, the website should be attractive as well as easily accessible for the users no matter what device they use. 

- We cannot create a website with fixed dimensions for each and every device that is currently present in the market because each device come in varying screen resolutions, definitions and orientations.
