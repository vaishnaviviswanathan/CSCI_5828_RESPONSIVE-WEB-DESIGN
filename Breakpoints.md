###Breakpoints
- The point at which a site changes its layout is called a breakpoint.

- Picking breakpoints based on device will cause severe maintenance issues.

- Moreover, new devices are constantly released. 

- It is practically hard to keep up with these changes.

- Hence, breakpoints should be chosen with respect to content. 

- A responsive website should adjust to a wide range of viewport sizes, independent of the device.
