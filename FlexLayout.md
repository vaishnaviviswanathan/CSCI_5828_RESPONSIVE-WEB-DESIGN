###Flexible Layouts:
<p>All websites are divided into some sort of grids. Flexible layout is the practice of building the layout of a website 
with a flexible grid that dynamically resizes itself according to the width. Absolute measurement units like pixels
or inches should be avoided because the viewport height and width continually change from device to device.
Website layouts need to adapt to this change and there are many constraints in absolute measurements. 
Hence, flexible grids are built using relative length units like percentages.Applying the concept of a flexible layout 
to every part of a grid will make it completely dynamic. The <code>min-width</code>, <code>max-width</code>, 
<code>min-height</code> and <code>max-height</code> properties 
help in achieving better control in the design.</p>
