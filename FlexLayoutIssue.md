###Benefits and Issues
- Applying the concept of a flexible layout to every part of a grid will make it completely dynamic. 

- However, when we keep scaling the browser viewport to smaller degrees, the columns may become too 
small to display content. 

- Text can become unclear and the layout can start breaking.

- In these cases, media queries can be used for better user experiences.
