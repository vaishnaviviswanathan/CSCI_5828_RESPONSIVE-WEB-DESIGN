###Flexible Media
<p>Images, videos and media need to be scalable as per the viewports.
To make the media fit to the viewport, one way is to set the <code>max-width</code>
property to 100%. This forces the image to match the width of the container. 
Modern browsers have evolved so much such that images are resized proportionally ie.
when the container and the image are resized, the aspect ration remains intact. </p>

<pre><code>img, video, canvas {
  max-width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>
