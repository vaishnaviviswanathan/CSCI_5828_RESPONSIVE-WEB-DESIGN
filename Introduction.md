Responsive Web Design is combination of an artistic architecture and an efficient adaptable design approach to Web Design. With increase is manufacturing and variety of hand-held, web surfing on such devices becomes increasingly common. </p>

<p>The underlying motivation to develop such web browser is to make sites look great across the dozens of devices in use today. Also, ome responsive web design patterns are such so as to accomodate any changes in the devices or their display sizes that may happen in the future.  The content of a website must reflow to adjust changes in the viewing size of a device dynamically. The idea is to "Think Responsively".</p>
