###Media Queries:
<p>Media queries help in changing CSS properties based on several criteria:</p>
<p>•	Width and height of the viewport</p>
<p>•	Width and height of the device</p>
<p>•	Orientation(landscape or portrait)</p>
<p>•	Resolution</p>
<p>A media query expression evaluates the criteria with the specified logical 
operations and applies the styles if the expression is true.</p>
