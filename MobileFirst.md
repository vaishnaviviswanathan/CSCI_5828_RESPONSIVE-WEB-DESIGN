###Mobile First:
<p>This approach emphasizes using smaller viewports as the default styles and then use
media queries to add styles as the viewport grows. A user who commonly uses a 
mobile device should not have to load for desktop and then reload again for
mobile devices. This saves bandwidth. Using media queries, downloading
unncessary media assets can be avoided. </p>
