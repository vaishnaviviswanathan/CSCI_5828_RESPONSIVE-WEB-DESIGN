<b>MOSTLY FLUID</b>

- This pattern consists of a fluid grid.

- In the smallest view, the div element is stacked vertically as we can see in the picture below. 

- Once the width hits 600px the primary div remains at width:100% whereas the secondary div elements are shown as two columns below the primary div element. 

- If the width hits more than 800px, the container div becomes fixed and is centered on the screen.


<b>ADVANTAGE</b>

- It requires only one breakpoint between small and large screens.
